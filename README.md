City Skyline üåá
Welcome to the City Skyline project! This repository is a visual exploration of city skylines using HTML, CSS, and web technologies. The project generates a dynamic city skyline complete with background and foreground buildings, blending beautiful color schemes and gradient effects to simulate an abstract cityscape.

üåÜ Overview
The City Skyline project features a layered cityscape with buildings of varying sizes and designs. This project is an excellent demonstration of how CSS can be used to create complex visuals with minimal HTML markup and no need for JavaScript or external libraries.

Features
Customizable Skyline: The project is designed to allow easy customization of building colors, heights, and window styles using CSS variables.
Responsive Design: The skyline adapts to screen sizes, ensuring that the visual experience remains cohesive on different devices.
Layered Architecture: The background and foreground buildings are constructed using divs and styled with gradients to give a depth effect.
Vibrant Color Scheme: Multiple custom building and window colors, changing based on the screen size for a different experience on mobile devices.
 Technologies Used
HTML5: Provides the basic structure of the project.
CSS3: Handles all the styling, including complex gradient backgrounds, building structures, and responsive design.
Responsive Design
On screens smaller than 1000px, the colors switch to a darker, monochromatic palette. You can modify the media queries to change this behavior as needed.

üöÄ Future Improvements
Dynamic Skylines: Implement JavaScript to allow the skyline to change dynamically based on the time of day.
Interactivity: Add hover effects or animations to the buildings for a more engaging user experience.
Parallax Scrolling: Introduce parallax scrolling effects for a more immersive cityscape experience.
üí° Inspiration
This project was inspired by the mesmerizing beauty of city skylines and the endless creative possibilities of CSS.
